    <p>
      My name is Keanu Rivers, I was born in St. Louis, MO. I move to Ariona 10
      years ago and have enjoyed being here becuase I met my wife here. I enjoy
      playing video games, hanging with friends and playing with my dog
      Marshall. I have always had a deep want to learn coding but never took the
      leap to learn. Now that I am learning I am enjoying making a career out of tech.
