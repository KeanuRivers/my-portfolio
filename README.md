# my-portfolio

Created my Portfolio using HTML and CSS

I used the screenshot of the refactored code for my first project.

I  was able to link and add icons to make my points of contact stand out

When clicking on the picture it will take you to the website

When you click on the email icon it will open your email and automatically assign me as the recipient 

When clicking on the LinkedIn icon, it will take you to my LinkedIn profile

When clicking on my GitHub it will take you to my profile to look at my projects

When I have more projects I will upload them to my portfolio for companies to look at
